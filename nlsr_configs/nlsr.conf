  ; lsa-refresh-time is the time in seconds, after which router will refresh its LSAs
  lsa-refresh-time 1800      ; default value 1800. Valid values 240-7200

  ; router-dead-interval is the time in seconds after which an inactive routers
  ; LSAs are removed
  ;router-dead-interval 3600 ; default value: 2*lsa-refresh-time. Value must be larger

  lsa-interest-lifetime 4    ; default value 4. Valid values 1-60

   hello-timeout 1                    ; interest time out value in integer. Default value 1

  ; adj-lsa-build-interval is the time to wait in seconds after an Adjacency LSA build is scheduled
  ; before actually building the Adjacency LSA

                             ; correctly. It is recommended not to set this

                             ; congestion for NFD.
